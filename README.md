### [Basic Java](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HV7su7zvHBMBp99OB73u2Uv11qMz9NGTRXgwygF-Irs/edit)

The above link goes to a google doc that contains a recommended schedule for learning Java with CodeAcademy, if you do not already know Java.

### [Installing FRC Prerequisites](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Curriculum2020/blob/master/InstallingFrcPrereqs.md)

This unit has the purpose of demonstrating how to download all of the programming prerequisites.

These include:

- GitHub Desktop
- FRC VS Code
- FRC vendor libraries
  - CTRE
  - Rev Robotics
  - NavX

These tools are needed for writing Java code for FRC robots. They are sufficient to control the simulated robot found in the 2020FRCSim. However, these tools are not sufficient to control a real world robot. All school computers should come with all software preinstalled, so you will not have to worry about these installations on school thinkpads. However, you will need to install the FRC vendor libraries for every new project you create.

### [Use of GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Curriculum2020/blob/master/GithubDesktop.md)

This unit has the purpose of teaching how to effectively use GitHub Desktop to download and upload repositories.

### [Basic Drive Code](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Curriculum2020/blob/master/BasicDriveCode.md)

This unit has the purpose of teaching how to write basic robot drive code.

### [Advanced Robot Controls](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Curriculum2020/blob/master/AdvancedRobotControls.md)

This unit has the purpose of teaching how to use more advanced robot mechanisms, such as pneumatics, gyroscopes and shuffleboard.

### [Code Structure](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Curriculum2020/blob/master/CodeStructure.md)

This unit has the purpose of teaching how to use this years code structure effectively. This is important for clean code and for collaboration.

### [Collaborative Coding](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Curriculum2020/blob/master/CodeCollaboration.md)

This unit has the purpose of teaching how to effectively use GitHub with a team, as well as discussing practices such as SCRUM.

### [Writing Tests](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Curriculum2020/blob/master/WritingTests.md)

This unity has the purpose of teaching how to write Junit Tests to validate code functionality.

### [PID](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Curriculum2020/blob/master/PID.md)

This unit has the purpose of teaching how to use PID, a tool which allows for more accurate control of motors and some other mechanisms.

### [Autonomous](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/Curriculum2020/blob/master/Autonomous.md)

This unit has the purpose of teaching how to write basic, time based autonomous programs and more advanced autonomous programs.
