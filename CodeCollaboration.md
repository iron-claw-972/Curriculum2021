# Code Collaboration

## 1. Purpose

This activity will introduce the procedures used when developing code with a team. Namely, the process of Pull Request approval and the reviewing of code and SCRUM.

## 2. Materials

- None

## 3. Instructions

### 3a. PR Approval

Pull Requests and the approval process is use due to two major factors. First, the master branch of the main robot code is very important. It is generally beneficial that it remains in a clean and stable state. Second, people are not perfect and make mistakes.

In order to protect the master branch of the robot code project and other important projects, we use the Pull Request approval system. In this system, all additions to the master branch must be made as branches then pulled to the master branch. Upon creating the pull request, you should notice that you cannot merge it into master. You first need to communicate with another programmer to approve your request. Feel free to ping leads to read and approve your code. After it is approved you can merge it.

Please read through the code you are approving and validate that the tests pass. While in previous years we have had a more relaxed policy on test in general, we are aiming to improve the rigor in this and future years.

### 3b. SCRUM

SCRUM is generally a framework for completing complex tasks. While it encompasses many concepts, we currently primarily use the concept of the Daily SCRUM. The Daily SCRUM is a short meeting where the team members of a given team meet and say a few things. These are:

1. What you have done in the past period of time.
2. What you are planning to do for the next period of time.
3. What, if anything, is blocking you from achieving your goals.

The goal of this is to give a general idea of what everyone is working on. Because of this, the answers to each question should be no more than 1-2 sentences in length. In our case, these will likely be posted at the end of each day to a dedicated slack channel.

These questions allow the team leader and the team members to understand the state of the project. Furthermore, the third question allows for people to talk about blocks they are encountering. This allows for other people to help and improves efficiency.

Another related concept is a MegaSCRUM. Let's consider a project has 10 unique teams working on it. It would take a significant amount of time for each individual from each team to share. Furthermore, it would not be particularly useful for understanding the state of the project as a whole. Therefore, the individual is abstracted. One representative of each team gives a SCRUM for the whole team's progress. While in team SCRUMs may occur daily. It is likely that a MegaSCRUM only occurs weekly or over an even greater period of time.
